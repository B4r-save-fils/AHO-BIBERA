## Problem Statement

In many communities, the voices of youth are often drowned out by older generations, leading to a lack of engagement in local decision-making processes. This creates a disconnect between the needs and aspirations of young people and the policies that affect their lives. 

### Key Issues:
- **Limited Youth Engagement:** Many young individuals feel that their opinions are not valued or heard within their communities.
- **Need for Local Voices:** Local governance often lacks the insights and perspectives of youth, which are crucial for fostering innovation and addressing current challenges.
- **Innovation Gaps:** Without an active role in shaping their environments, young people miss opportunities to drive innovation and solutions tailored to their unique experiences.

### Call to Action:
Encouraging youth participation through innovative platforms and collaborative initiatives can bridge the gap, ensuring their voices are integral in local decision-making processes.
